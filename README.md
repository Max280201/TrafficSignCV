# TrafficSignCV

This repository is part of our work on the topic Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition for the module Integration Seminar in course WWI20DSB supervised by Prof. Dr. Bernhard Drabant at the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Mannheim.

It includes a traffic sign detection, traffic sign classification and one demo to combine both.
